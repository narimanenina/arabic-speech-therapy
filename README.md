# AI-based Speech Analysis and Segmentation for Children with Phonological Disorders

## Description
This project focuses on using Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyze and segment speech produced by children with phonological speech disorders.  
The goal is to support research and clinical applications in speech therapy by providing automated tools for speech analysis.

## Objectives
- Analyze children's speech signals
- Segment speech into phonemes or syllables
- Detect phonological errors using AI models
- Assist speech therapists and researchers

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- Speech Processing
- Librosa
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of speech recordings of children with phonological disorders.  
Data may be manually annotated for training and evaluation purposes.

> Note: Sensitive data is not shared publicly.

## Project Status
- Data collection: in progress
- Manual annotation: in progress
- Model development: planned

## Future Work
- Improve segmentation accuracy
- Add automatic error classification
- Build a simple user interface for therapists
